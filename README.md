# Generic neural network

This is a simple and generic implementation of a neural network.
There is no learning method or anything. It is only the structure.
It's very simple to create a neural network of any size : from only 1 layer to anything. Same for the number of neurons by layer.

You can chose between random weights for any neurons to begin with, or set them yourself using the second constructor of the neural network. Or changing the weights after the network created (via a new function).
